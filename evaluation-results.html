Hello! I see you&#39;re inquiring about the status of a partial refund related to order #12356. Let me help you with that.

Based on our records, a partial refund of $25 was initiated on November 4th. However, the first refund attempt was unsuccessful due to an expired payment method. A second refund attempt was processed to an alternate payment method on file.

I recommend checking your original payment method and bank statements to confirm the refund&#39;s receipt. If you haven&#39;t seen the funds, I can help escalate this for further investigation. Would you like me to look into the specific details of the refund transaction?

Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Fail Reason: The output focuses solely on the partial refund issue and does not mention or acknowledge a successful replacement; it only discusses the refund attempts and offers to investigate further.">[FAIL] (0.67)

The output clearly explains that the initial refund of $25.00 failed due to the original payment method expiring, and notes that a second refund attempt was made. However, it does NOT explicitly state that the new refund was issued to an alternate payment method. Instead, it asks the customer to confirm the card or provide a different one, implying that the second attempt may still require payment method confirmation, but it does not state the new attempt used an alternate payment method.
