## 🎯 Overview

This repository provides a **complete evaluation framework** for validating LLM-powered chatbots that handle sensitive customer information like orders, payments, and personal data. It's built using [Promptfoo](https://promptfoo.dev), the industry-standard tool for LLM testing.

### Why This Matters

When your chatbot shares order details and payment information:
- **One mistake** can expose sensitive customer data (PII, credit cards)
- **Hallucinated information** can damage customer trust
- **Inconsistent responses** create poor user experience
- **Security vulnerabilities** can lead to data breaches

This framework helps you **prevent these issues before production**.
